This project shows various samples demonstrating the usage of Spring for Apache Kafka.
Each sample is a standalone Spring Boot application located in its own subdirectory.
To run a sample, navigate to its directory and use the command:
`./mvnw spring-boot:run` or build it with `./mvnw clean package` and run the resulting jar file.
Make sure you have access to a Kafka broker; you can configure the broker address in the `application.yml` file of each sample.
